# Corobot ROS Kinetic stack

Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and ROS Kinetic were used.

This is the final year project of K Elamparithi, Monish Kanna R and Deepika J.
The group revived an old Coroware CoroBot and implemented teleoperation with a differential drive. 
Hector SLAM and Gmapping were implemented subsequently.
